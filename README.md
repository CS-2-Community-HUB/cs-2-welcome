# Welcome to the CS² Community!

**CS² (CS-Squared)** is student-driven space at MSU dedicated to empowering learners in computer science and cybersecurity.

We foster collaboration, creativity, and curiosity through inclusive peer support, hands-on exploration, and shared opportunities.

Our mission is to build a strong foundation for technical growth, innovative thinking, and career readiness — together. Contribute meaningfully—whether you're a beginner or advanced

We believe that success in tech is not just about code—it's about connection, confidence, and collective empowerment.
