# CS² Community Code of Conduct

This community is dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and empowering space for all members—especially those from multiply minoritized identities in computing.

We expect everyone to:

- Be respectful in communication, including disagreement
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior
- Honor privacy and do not share others' content without permission
- Support a culture of learning, not perfection

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please reach out privately to Deb or Maciej. Reports will be taken seriously and handled with care and discretion.

Let's build something meaningful—together.
